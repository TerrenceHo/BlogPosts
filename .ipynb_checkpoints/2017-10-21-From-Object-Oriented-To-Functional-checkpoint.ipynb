    "# Using Functional Programming to Encapsulate Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Many coders have heard of the term \"functional programming\", but have often never really used it or its properties.  Especially if they came from Java, where there are no real functions, only methods (each function has to be attached to an object, and cannot stand by itself). Functions are commomly thought of as defining behavior. However, if you were to think of functions as data, limitations like having to attach a method to an object to define behavior goes away.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example of this, we will implement a calculator.  We will start with a more object oriented version, and then progressively replace functionality of the calculator with functional parts, while maintaining the same overall goal of having a calculator.\n",
